    </h4>
    <p class="w-full mt-4 font-medium leading-tight text-gray-500 text-md">
      Yes! We offer both contactless and Chip(s) & Pin. We also offer over the
      phone card payments. You may just have to come and try it for yourself
      sometime, the chips are lovely this time of year.

      <span class="pr-1">🤔</span> Do you do gluten free?
    </h4>
    <p class="w-full mt-4 font-medium leading-tight text-gray-500 text-md">
      Sure do! We please ask that you call ahead, to make sure that we can do
      our best. However, we don't take gluten free orders on Friday nights, due
      to it being the busiest time for us.

      <span class="pr-1">📞</span> Do you take phone orders?
    </h4>
    <p class="w-full mt-4 font-medium leading-tight text-gray-500 text-md">
      Give us a bell! Phone orders must be paid by card over the phone prior to
      collection. It is also important to note that we don't take gluten free
      orders on Friday nights, due to it being the busiest time for us.

      Absolutely! To ensure that we can do our best to help make your day that
      little bit more special, we ask for a minimum of 48 hours notice.
