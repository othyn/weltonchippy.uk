    </h4>

      Yes! We offer both contactless and Chip(s) & Pin. We also offer over the
      phone card payments. You may just have to come and try it for yourself
      sometime, the chips are lovely this time of year.

      <span class="pr-1">🤔</span> Do you do gluten free?
    </h4>
    <p class="w-full mt-4 text-md font-medium leading-tight text-gray-500">
      Sure do! We please ask that you call ahead, to make sure that we can do
      our best. However, we don't take gluten free orders on Friday nights, due
      to it being the busiest time for us.

      <span class="pr-1">📞</span> Do you take phone orders?
    </h4>
    <p class="w-full mt-4 text-md font-medium leading-tight text-gray-500">
      Give us a bell! However, during these COVID times, phone orders must be
      paid by card over the phone prior to collection. It is also important to
      note that we don't take gluten free orders on Friday nights, due to it
      being the busiest time for us.
